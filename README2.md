# hw01-code-refactor

CHANGELOG 1:

Added comments between sections for better ease of use

Added larger spacings between sections of separate relevance

Semantic elements left alone due to specificity of nesting

Further consolidation of classes unknown if possible without breaking it at current knowledge

DEV COMMENTS/QUERIES: 

Unknown why using presets first for color/font settings (line 87) as opposed to using classes directly. May be due to use of the !important tags used in the classes sections for the color/font settings

Lack of understanding into use of paths with coordinates as in line 614 or if it is just a copied location for the link. Link itself leads to a w3 XML namespace. Read the description on the site and don't understand what the attribute names would be used for here

Some colors of text seem off while still being functional. Unknown cause.

Address queries later when time permits.
